--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Pull Type
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

||| A `Pull f o es r` is a - possibly infinite - series of effectful
||| computations running in monad `f`, producing an arbitrary sequence
||| of chunks of values of type `c o` along the way, that eventually
||| terminates either with an error of type `HSum es` or with a result
||| of type `r`.
|||
||| A `Pull` is a monad with relation to `r`, so a sequencing of `Pull`s
||| via bind `(>>=)` means a sequencing of the chunks of output generated
||| along the way. For instance, the following `Pull` will produce the
||| values `[1,2,3,4,5,6]` when being run:
|||
||| ```idris2
||| emit [1,2,3] >> emit [4,5,6]
||| ```
|||
||| A `Pull` provides capabilities for safe resource management via
||| `FS.Scope`s, allowing us to release allocated resources as soon as
|||
|||  * the pull is exhausted and produces no more output.
|||  * evaluating the pull aborts with an error.
|||  * a pull will not longer be asked to produce additional values
|||    because an outer pull has been exhaused.
|||
||| The last case occurs for instance when we stop evaluating a `Stream`
||| via `take` or `takeWhile`.
|||
||| About the effect type `f`: Most non-trivial `Pull`s and `Stream`s come
||| with the potential of failure. In addition, running a `Pull` to completion
||| requires (thread-local) mutable state to keep tracks of the evaluation
||| scopes. Effect type `f` must therefore implement interface `Data.Linear.ELift1`
||| at the very least. This still allows us to run a `Pull` or `Stream`
||| as a pure computation, for instance when using `Control.Monad.Elin`.
|||
||| Most of the time, however, we are interested in streams that produce
||| arbitrary side-effects, and an I/O monad such as `IO.Async` is required.
|||
||| A note on totality: Theoretically, we should be able define `Bind` as follows:
|||
||| ```idris
||| Bind : Pull f o es r -> Inf (r -> Pull f o es s) -> Pull f o es s
||| ```
|||
||| This would allow us to safely generate total, infinite streams of output
||| and only running a `Pull` would be a non-total function. In practice, however,
||| I found this approach to have various shortcomings: We'd need a custom
||| bind operator for defining infinite pulls. That's not hard to implement, but
||| I found it to be fairly limited and cumbersome to use, especially since
||| type inference got very erratic. For the time being, I therefore decided
||| to resort to `assert_total` when defining potentially infinite streams.
||| It's not pretty, but it gets the job done.
