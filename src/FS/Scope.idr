-- Interrupt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

||| An interruption handler.
|||
||| This is used for cross-stream interruption when running streams in
||| parallel. For instance, when nondeterministically merging two streams
||| A and B (see `FS.Concurrent.merge`), A and B will be run in parallel
||| each on its own fiber. Both should be interrupted if downstream terminates,
||| for instance because the number of emitted values have been limited via
||| a call to `take`.
|||
||| Implementation detail: When running a stream, we check on each iteration
||| whether the current scope has been interrupted or not. In addition, in
||| case of wrapped effectful computations - which might be potentially long
||| running (think of a timer or waiting for a connection or a mouse click) -
||| the wrapped effect is raced against the stream being interrupted.
public export
data Interrupt : (f : List Type -> Type -> Type) -> Type where
  None : Interrupt f
  I    : (def : Deferred World a) -> Interrupt (Async e)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Scopes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

||| IDs for comparing and ordering scopes. This is for internal
||| use only. In particular, looking at the internal representation
||| of a `ScopeID` via `Show` is *not* referentially transparent and
||| should be used for debugging purposes only.
export
record ScopeID where
  constructor SID
  val : Nat

export %inline
Eq ScopeID where
  SID x == SID y = x == y

export %inline
Ord ScopeID where
  compare (SID x) (SID y) = compare x y

export %inline
Show ScopeID where
  show = show . val

||| Cancelation scopes
|||
||| Functional streams are evaluated in scopes, which are organized as
||| a tree, just like stream evaluation can be thought of as a tree:
||| Sequencing of streams means nesting in the resulting scope tree,
||| while parallel evaluation (for instance, when zipping or merging
||| streams) means branching. Once a stream is exhausted,
||| it's scope is cleaned up and all resources allocated in this scope
||| are released, including the resources of all child scope.
|||
||| In addition to (internal) cancelation, streams can be run concurrently,
||| in which case the can be interrupted by an external event such as
||| the exhaustion of a timer or the termination of another stream.
||| At every evaluation step of a stream we check, if the current scope
||| has been canceled. If this is the case, evaluation of the stream
||| is aborted.
|||
||| Just like `Pull`s and `Stream`s, a `Scope` is parameterized by its
||| effect type.
public export
record Scope (f : List Type -> Type -> Type) where
  constructor S
  ||| this scope's unique identifier
  id        : ScopeID

  ||| ID of this scope's root scope
  root      : ScopeID

  ||| parent scopes `([parent, grand-parent, ... , root])`
  ancestors : List ScopeID

  ||| optional cleanup hook for a resource allocated in this scope
  cleanup   : List (f [] ())

  children  : List ScopeID

  ||| Handler to check for stream interruption
  interrupt : Interrupt f

-- Compilation Targets
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

||| Target effect of stream compilation.
|||
||| Effect type `f` (of type `List Type -> Type -> Type`) can be used to
||| run (= evaluate) streams in state thread `s`.
||| Currently, this is either `Elin s` for running synchronous streams in state
||| effect `s`, or `Async e` for running streams concurrently.
|||
||| If `s` is universally quantified, `Elin s` streams can be converted to pure
||| functions making use of local mutable state, resource management, and error
||| handling. If `s` equals `World`, `Elin World` can be used as a regular
||| (synchronous) monad with error handling.
