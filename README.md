# Effectful, Concurrent Streams

This is a library for defining and manipulating streams of data in a clear, concise,
safe, and performant way. In this tutorial, we are going to look in detail
at the capabilities provided by this library. This is a literate Idris2 file,
so we start with some imports and some utilities:

```idris
module README

import IO.Async.Loop.Posix
import FS.Elin as E
import FS.Posix
import System

%default total

0 Prog : Type -> Type
Prog = AsyncStream Poll [Errno]

covering
runProg : Prog Void -> IO ()
runProg prog =
  simpleApp $ mpull (handle [stderrLn . interpolate] prog)
```

## Streams of Data

An `FS.Stream.Stream f es o` can be thought of as a possibly infinite
sequence of values of type `o`, the evaluation and generation of which
happens in effect type `f`, and that might fail with one of the
errors in `es` (a list of types). The API provided by `FS.Stream` is
in many ways similar as the one provided for `List`s: Streams can
be mapped and filtered, their values can be accumulated, and they form
a monad, so that we can get streams of streams, which - just like with
`List`s - will concatenate and emit all values of the inner streams
in sequence. Here's a very simple example:

```idris
example : Stream f es Nat
example = iterate (List _) Z S |> C.takeWhile (< 10_000_000) |> C.sum
```

Let's break this down: `iterate Z S` generates an infinite stream of
values by repeatedly applying the second argument to the first. In this case,
it generates the sequence of natural numbers. Function `takeWhile`
emits values from a stream until the given predicate returns `False`.
Finally, `sum` accumulates all emitted values in the obvious way.
The operator we use (`|>`) is just reverse function composition from
the Prelude.

There are many ways we can run and test an example, but probably the
canonical one is to run it through an effectful sink, for instance, by
logging the generated values to `stdout`:

```idris
covering
runExample : IO ()
runExample = runProg (foreach prntLn example)
```

If you run the above (for instance, at the REPL by invoking `:exec runExample`),
you will notice that it prints its result almost immediately, without
consuming a lot of memory. And while a pure recursive function might compute
the result much quicker, doing the same thing with a list that first
has to be generated will be considerably slower, especially when we start
increasing the limit in the predicate.

For instance, on my system this simple test function takes 1.5 seconds when
the limit is increased to `100_000_000`, while doing the same with a simple
list takes more than ten seconds and consumes about 2 GB of memory. It even
completes with the limit set to one billion, while the corresponding
list function runs out of memory (which is to be expected).

### Streaming `IO`

While having a versatile API for working with pure streams of values can be
useful, the real use case for libraries such as this one is to stream data
coming from and going to `IO` sources and sinks: Files, sockets, databases.

Here's a second example, which reads a text file line by line and converts
all numeric entries from degrees Fahrenheit to Celsius.

```idris
toCelsius : ByteString -> Double
toCelsius bs =
  case parseDouble bs of
    Nothing => 0.0
    Just f  => (f - 32.0) * (5.0/9.0)

fahrenheit : Prog Void
fahrenheit =
     readBytes "resources/fahrenheit.txt"
  |> lines
  |> C.filterNot (\x => null (trim x) || isPrefixOf "//" x)
  |> C.mapOutput (fromString . show . toCelsius)
  |> unlines
  |> writeTo Stdout
```

The above will convert every line in file `resources/fahrenheit.txt`
to Celsius, skipping empty lines and comments. This is already very
convenience, but under the hood, it does so much more:

* It performs error handling: When the file in question is not present
  or can't be read, it will fail with an exception of type `Errno` and
  print it to `stderr`.
* If the file can be opened, it will be properly closed when the
  stream of values has been exhausted.

Here's an example that can potentially open thousands of files (given
as command-line arguments) and emit their content as a stream of
`ByteStrings`, which will then be processed one line at a time.

```idris
-- Opens every file listed as a command-line arguments,
-- streaming its content and cutting it into a stream
-- of lines. Every line is annotated with its index in the
-- stream and the longest line is printed together with its
-- index.
--
-- Resources are managed automatically: Every file is closed
-- as soon as it has been exhausted, so this can be used to
-- stream thousands of files.
idrisLines : Prog String -> Prog Void
idrisLines args =
     args
  |> observe stdoutLn
  |> bind readBytes
  |> lines
  |> C.mapOutput size
  |> C.zipWithIndex
  |> C.fold max (Z,Z)
  |> printLnTo Stdout

prog : List String -> Prog Void
prog []     = throw EINVAL
prog (_::t) = case t of
  ["fahrenheit"]   => fahrenheit
  ["example"]      => example |> printLnTo Stdout
  "idris-lines"::t => idrisLines (emits t)
  _                => stderrLn "Invalid commandline arguments"

covering
main : IO ()
main = getArgs >>= runProg . prog
